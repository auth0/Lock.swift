/**
 *  Handles authentication using `SFSafariViewController` for either a specific connection or just shows Auth0 Lock web login form.
 *  In iOS 9 you need to have Universal Links configured for your Auth0 subdomain and for older versions it will fallback to custom schemes.
 *  The callback URL will be:
 *  - Universal Link: `https://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/ios/{BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER}/callback`
 *  - Custom Scheme: `{BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER}://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/ios/{BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER}/callback`
 *  So you need to add them to your Application `Allowed Callbacks` section in Auth0 Dashboard
 *
 *  You can also force it to use a custom scheme by setting the flag `useUniversalLink` to `NO` when initialising the authenticator
 * 
 * ## Universal Links (iOS 9+)
 * 
 * Auth0 provides support to use callbacks as universal links by serving the file `https://{auth0 domain}/apple-app-site-association`, 
 * the only requirement is to provide the application bundleIdentifier and Apple Developer TeamId in your Auth0 Application settings.
